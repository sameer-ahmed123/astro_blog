As much as I love diving deep into code and the intricacies of web development, I've learned that a fulfilling life requires balance. When I step away from the screen, I find myself drawn to activities that recharge and inspire me in different ways.


You'll often find me hitting the gym to stay active and clear my head. Physical exercise is a great way to de-stress and bring a fresh perspective back to coding challenges.


The hiking trails around  Margalla Hills are another favorite escape. There's something about being out in nature, surrounded by the landscape, that sparks creativity and provides a welcome break from the digital world.


And of course, I can't forget my furry companions â€“ cats! Their calm presence and occasional playful antics are a constant source of joy and relaxation.
