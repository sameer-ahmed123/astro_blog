In the world of web development, the backend is where the magic often happens behind the scenes. For many of my projects, I've found myself consistently drawn to <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>
<b>"The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines"</b>


Coming from a Computer Science background, Django's robust architecture, its "batteries-included" philosophy, and its strong community resonated with me. Whether it's handling user authentication, managing databases, or building APIs, Django provides a solid foundation and streamlines the development process.


My experience building projects with Django has further solidified my appreciation for Django's capabilities in creating scalable and maintainable applications.

Looking ahead, I'm also eager to explore the world of serverless architectures. The idea of building and deploying applications without managing traditional servers is incredibly appealing, and it's definitely on my "to-learn" list. This exploration will likely complement my existing Django skills, offering new ways to build and deploy applications.

 So, while Django remains a key part of my toolkit, I'm excited about the potential of new backend paradigms and learning about new frontend technologies like astro.
